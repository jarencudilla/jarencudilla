### 🐞 About Me

I'm the guy testers go to when they're stuck, leads go to when they need answers, and devs go to when something breaks and no one knows why.

🧪 **Head of QA** — Testing strategies, automation, performance checks, UAT... and yelling at flaky pipelines.

⚙️ **Former PM & Scrum Master** — I've translated chaos into Jira tickets and made sure things actually ship.

📢 **Content Creator** — I built [QAJourney.net](https://qajourney.net) and [EngineeredAI.net](https://engineeredai.net) to help people learn QA, automation, and AI without corporate fluff.

🛠️ **Tools of the trade:** Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, k6, Burp Suite, Claude, ChatGPT

🧠 **Languages:** JavaScript (primary), Python (actively learning), Ruby on Rails & C (relearning), Elixir (planned), and a dangerous amount of Markdown

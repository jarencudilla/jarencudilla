### 🐞 About Me

I'm the guy testers go to when they're stuck, leads go to when they need answers, and devs go to when something breaks and no one knows why.

🧪 **Head of QA** — Testing strategies, automation, performance checks, UAT... and yelling at flaky pipelines.  
⚙️ **Project Manager** — I translate chaos into Jira tickets and make sure things actually ship.  
📢 **Content Creator** — I built [QAJourney.net](https://qajourney.net) and [EngineeredAI.net](https://engineeredai.net) to help people learn QA, automation, and AI without corporate fluff.

🛠️ Tools of the trade: Cypress, Playwright, Selenium, k6, Burp Suite  
🧠 Languages: JavaScript (primary), Python (secondary), and a dangerous amount of Markdown
